# icefy
icefy is a Python library that helps to manage product development with the **ICE system**

## What is ICE?

The ICE scoring method is a framework used to prioritize ideas or features for a product based on three key factors: **Impact**, **Confidence**, and **Ease**. Each factor is assigned a score, typically on a scale from 1 to 10.

- **Impact** refers to the potential effect the feature will have on the product or its users.
- **Confidence** measures how certain you are about your estimates for impact and ease.
- **Ease** gauges how simple or difficult it will be to implement the feature, considering time, resources, and complexity.

The ICE score is calculated by multiplying these three values, helping teams prioritize tasks that have the highest potential for success with the least effort. Itâ€™s a practical way to evaluate ideas when resources are limited.
